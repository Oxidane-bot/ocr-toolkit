COM122: Critique and Critical Reading Exercise Edit submission Eduglobal College Online Learning
Done
To synthesize is to combine ideas and crea ate a completely new dea. That new idea becomes the conclusion you have drawn from your
reading. This is the true beauty of reading: it cau ses us to weigh ideas, to compare, judge, think, and explore- and then to arrive at a
moment that we hadn't known before. We begin with a simple summary, work through analysis, evaluate using critique, and then move
on to synthesis
In your own words, try to answer the questions below. To start with a critique, you don't need to go in depth or use full sentences, but you
want toj jot down your ideas.
How did you respond to the piece? Did you like it? Did it appeal to you? Could you identify with it?
Do you agree with the main ideas in the text!
Did you find any errors in reasoning? What might have been missed or not addressed?
Did the organization make: sense?
las evidence used correctly, without manipulation? Has the writer used appropriate sources for support?
the author objective? Biased? Reasonable?
Are the text's tone and language appropriate?
Are all of the author's statements clear? Is anything confusing?
What worked well in the text! What was lacking or failed completely?
What is the cultural context* of the text?
The answers to these questions will help you start to build a critique of the text, which will in turn allow you to evaluate it, come to a
conclusion or build a reflection of the text. We will continue on these skills in the following chapters.
